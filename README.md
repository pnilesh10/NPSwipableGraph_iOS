Implementation of swipable grpah with core plot

# Info
I have implemented a swipable graph view with help of google's opensourcce core plot framework. you can swipe left/ right to see more information about the data. 
for e.g. how will you show information of last 24hrs with the help of graph?

With the help of this component, you can show this information in intuitive way.
